# DayZSA-Autowalker
Keyboard hook written in Java for the game DayZ

I use JavaDecompiler <http://jd.benow.ca/> to get the source because i want to rewrite it for azerty keyboard and handle running state in game.

Later i have found source here https://github.com/feonx/DayZSA-Autowalker , so i forked and push modifications.
